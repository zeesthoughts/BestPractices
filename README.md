## Code Quality

### 1. Clean Code Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear, meaningful names
- Follow single responsibility principle (SRP)
- Keep functions and classes small and focused
- Maintain consistent code formatting
- Avoid deep nesting
- Delete dead/commented-out code

### 2. SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: A class should have only one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Avoid code duplication
- Abstract common functionality
- Use design patterns appropriately

## Version Control

### 1. Git Best Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use feature branches
- Keep main/master branch stable
- Regularly pull and rebase

### 2. Branching Strategy
- Use GitFlow or trunk-based development
- Name branches consistently (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
- Delete merged branches
- Protect main branches

## Testing

### 1. Testing Pyramid
- Unit Tests: Test individual components
- Integration Tests: Test component interactions
- End-to-End Tests: Test complete workflows

### 2. Testing Principles
- Write tests first (TDD when possible)
- Keep tests simple and readable
- Test edge cases
- Maintain test independence
- Aim for high test coverage

## Security

### 1. Basic Principles
- Never store sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all inputs
- Keep dependencies updated

### 2. Common Vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Security Misconfiguration
- Broken Authentication

## Documentation

### 1. Code Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Explain complex algorithms
- Include usage examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use clear and concise language

### 2. Project Documentation
- Maintain a detailed README
- Include setup instructions
- Document architecture decisions
- Keep deployment procedures updated
- Add troubleshooting guides

## Code Review

### 1. Review Guidelines
- Review for functionality
- Check code style and standards
- Look for potential bugs
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure documentation is updated

### 2. Review Process
- Use pull/merge requests
- Provide constructive feedback
- Address all comments
- Verify changes meet requirements
- Maintain a positive review culture

## Architecture

### 1. Design Principles
- Keep it simple (KISS)
- Design for change
- Separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Consider scalability

### 2. Architecture Patterns
- Microservices
- Layered Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design
- Clean Architecture

## Performance

### 1. Optimization Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on critical paths
- Cache appropriately
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor resource usage

### 2. Common Practices
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement pagination
- Optimize assets
- Use asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
